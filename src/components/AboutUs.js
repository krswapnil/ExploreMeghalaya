      <h1>History</h1>

      <p>
        The Khasi and Pnar communities (who are regarded as distinct groups
        under the same tribal umbrella) were adept in trade and commerce and
        their influence was spread from the hills into the plains of Sylhet
        (present-day Bangladesh). Limestone and iron were some of the major
        exports from the region – as recorded in some 18th-century records. In
        the early 19th century (1824), the British were firmly entrenched in
        most of the sub-continent. To deal with a conflict with the Burmese
        empire they developed diplomatic relationships with the Khasi-Pnar
        tribes to create corridors for easier access to the Assam plains. Over
        the next decades, they faced stiff resistance from some unwilling chiefs
        and royals who did not trust their trespass of independent tribal lands
        and this gave the Europeans a pretext for military action and
        ultimately, political domination. The most well-known freedom fighters
        of the tribes were U Tirot Sing (Khasi Hills), U Kiang Nongbah (Jaintia
        Hills), and Pa Togan Sangma (Garo Hills).

      <h1>Culture</h1>
      <p>
        The main ethnic communities of Meghalaya include Khasis, Garo, and
        Jaintia. It is believed that people from these communities came to
        Meghalaya from South East Asia. The people of Meghalaya are known for
        their cheerful nature and adaptability.Each community has its customs
        and cultural traditions the Khasis (of Mon-Khmer ancestry), the Garos
        (of Tibeto-Burman origin), and the Jaintias said to be from South East
        Asia. The common trait binding all three communities is its matrilineal
        system in which the family lineage is taken from the mother’s side.
        While many people from the Khasi, Jaintia, and Garo communities have
        converted to Christianity hence we can easily see many churches,
        temples, mosques, gurudwaras, and monasteries in Meghalaya. The region
        is rich in tribal culture and folk tradition. Dance and drinking along
        with the sound of buffalo horns, flutes, and mridangas form an integral
        part of the social ceremonies and religious ceremonies. Marriage
        relationships are outside their clan.
